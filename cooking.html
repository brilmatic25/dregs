   <h3><br><br>"Thank you, you have<br>very pretty hands"</h3><br>
     <p class="first">
      I'd never really looked at my grandma's hands before, but upon inspection I recognized all the work she did 
      to make sure they looked pretty: the history of creams and oils; the indirect effects of hydrating moisturizers. 
      I'm sure you can tell how soft they are just by looking, and you should peep the way she tries to contain her 
      excitement whenever someone holds them admiringly. "Make sure you treat your mother with respect," strangers like 
      to say whenever we're together. I lost my mother, her daughter, at a young age and spent the rest of my adolescence 
      in her guardianship, so it's not like they were wrong.
     </p>
     <p>
      But my grandma's hands are not fragile. They are not dainty nor weak, though they do bear a fair amount of 
      delicacy. If you could <em>FEEL</em> her hands--if you could feel the way they held onto my cheeks when I was little—you'd 
      be able to apprehend their undeniable durability, their quiet vigor, their pretty plumpness resulting from a mild 
      addiction to porkchops. My grandma's hands are, without a doubt, a Black woman's hands. They're like a pillow that's 
      been through a lot, but managed to wash itself off and still be so many's place of rest and comfort.
     <p>
      I look at my grandma's hands, I remember my grandma's hands, I think about my grandma's hands and wonder what 
      it is like to be flesh and body at the same time. And this is bigger than the pursuit of respectability through 
      the pursuit of beauty norms. It's really about respect. It's really about the fact that the next time I see my grandma's 
      hands I will make sure to hold them, make sure to make my grandma want to smile.

      So here we have at least three thinkers paradoxically engaging Black visual cultures from the synesthetic 
      standpoint imagined through some form of removal of the hegemony of sight, and all until this point independently. 
      And within it all, I am most interested in how we attempt to collaterally negate hegemonic loci of fixation—how we 
      forget or forgo any notion of a center—on the way to an investigation of the "some things else" that operate past and 
      around and through said center. In other words, I am interested in how, despite its obvious necessity, the simple negation 
      of the “point” is not the point for us, and how this stance indicates a "darker" form of revolt which bears a tangential, 
      centrifugitive, and holodimensional mode of "parallel processing" which I have for the past year been calling <strong><em><u>kin-aesthetics</u></em></strong>.
     </p>

     <img class="black-hole-img" src="img/Black-Hole-Clipped.png">

     <p>
      In what ways are we freed from the hegemony of the center when we decide to begin where the center ends? When we, for the 
      sake of analogy, think of a black hole's event horizon as its "circular axis" rather than attempting to define it on the 
      basis of linear axes, we enact a paradigmatic shift from Descartes to one of an ensemble insofar as we forgo the location of 
      the origin at a fictional center representing the nexus, intersection, or synthesis of a couplet of dichotomous elements 
      (x and y, horizontal and vertical, man and woman, white and black, bourgeoisie and proletariat, human and animal, sense and 
      nonsense, electric and magnetic, space and time). Instead, the origin is understood as "just after," or, more precisely, as 
      centrifugitively falling around and in love with a more impossible Origin—its path or trace of orbit constituting a blurred 
      and necessarily troubled precipice.</p>
     <p>
      The Cartesian grid, and the whiteness, humanity and modernity that take it as philosophical basis are all shown here to 
      be, at all times and all at the same time, invested in the particularization of this Origin, the annihilation of the awareness 
      of its predominant infinitude, and the absconding of its indomitable unknowability. Whiteness takes infinity, splits it apart, 
      and frames it as a pair of nothings (0, 0). But at and after the end, the truth is 
      there is no interpretable center or origin or “point”, though there is a referable structurality of and playing with the structure that 
      we can begin to decipher. This is the Schwarz-childishly rotating "ring around the rosie," the performational string of the 
      theory of being with which blackness is constantly weaving into (con)textiles in the joyful name of its collective self-fashioning 
      and "advanced transgressive publicity." When Tina Campt exhorts us to listen to these images instead of merely looking at them, 
      she steps if not dances past the traditional obsession with looking, obviates the obvious, strips looking and its attenuated 
      meanings down to its bare quietude, amplifies the illegible frequencies of Black life until we feel it in our throats. The fact 
      that these images could only be listened to in this way after having had their eyes and/or removed indicates the significance of losing 
      sight of transparent identity, of selves.</p>

      We might get even further here by emphasizing the “kin” dimension of kin-aesthetics. In discussion about Black grandmothers and 
      the comfort one receives in the presence of Black grandmothers even when you’ve never met them before (a comfort very 
      different from that which is derived from the performance of ownership), I proposed to my friend Mekleit that that state 
      of comfort might be how white people feel all the time, like every stranger could be their grandmother or more generally 
      their kin, and therefore they can always expect to be taken care of—their belonging in the world is guaranteed and insured 
      by anti-blackness, never provisional. Not only does such a thought unveil the commodity fetishism of the self insofar as it 
      shows the production of the sense of a “whole self” to be necessarily predicated on something akin to a village mentality 
      required for care of self or self-care, but it also points back to the mechanisms of the aforementioned affective economy 
      of humanity to the extent it positions the notion of human kinship, that village mentality, in necessary conflation with 
      the shadenfreudean high that stems from the surplus of fleshly violence, i.e. the picnic around the magnolia tree. What this 
      leads to is a clarification of this work’s critique of humanity: while humanity in the modern sense stems from the socialization 
      of the surplus that is generated by violence against the subhuman and especially female captive flesh, there still lies a need 
      for a kind of surplus in general by all anthropomorphic life, one that lets us know we’ll be taken care of and one that we may 
      extrapolate beyond our particular geographies as a general worldview among strangers. For now, let’s call this a <strong><em><u>kinship surplus</u></em></strong>, 
      which is necessarily affective, but, unlike humanity, not necessarily economic. Perhaps the necessity of this kinship surplus is 
      one reason Sylvia Wynter refused to leave humanism entirely behind, despite its brutal histories and fleshly terrors.
     </p>
     <p>
      What if the notion of an African diaspora was implicitly designed to develop this precise kind of kinship surplus, to make 
      every Black person feel like every other Black person could be their grandma, to offer a wholeness that is always more than 
      the sum of their parts? What if the difficulties of embracing a diasporic framework to blackness stems directly from the fact 
      of wounded kinship that is slavery’s legacy and Western humanity’s fundamental impulse? In turn, what if hapticality bears a 
      theoretical supplement of intimacy that is necessary to account for such wounded kinship, and more generally for the airy feel 
      of diaspora’s abstract and extrapolative connotations? The closing of eyes, the washing of hands, the intimacy of deep water; 
      might we dare say this is how it should feel to be Black and alive, foreverywhere? “Like hydrogen, like oxygen?” Even when 
      humanity weathers? I am trying to help build a world from scratch in which I am enough.</p>
     <p>
      Before Moten speaks of Aunt Hester and her resistance is Spillers and her "zero-degree conceptualization" of Aunt Hester’s 
      flesh. But before, and thus into the negatives of flesh, in the hidden depth of the singularity of fleshly surface, the 
      “under” part of the ground upon which bodies stand, there is Hartman insofar as the very reason Aunt Hester was made to 
      scream and hush was to punish her wayward search for pleasure. This search for autonomously-driven pleasure, which is 
      inextricable from a pursuit to rehabilitate wounded kinship, dawns upon us as an "insistent previousness" even in Hartman's 
      articulation of it as a response to the afterlives of slavery. Auntie broke the law by insisting she not only participate in 
      pleasure but that she be the one to set its scene, and it is this anarchic, improvisational, and limitlessly generative 
      scene-setting which, for whiteness's/ coloniality’s/ modernity’s/ capitalism’s/ humanity’s sake, must be sycophantically negated 
      by the compensatory scene of subjection. Aunt Hester’s joy is trapped in a repulsion that will not let her leave, but is the 
      notion of an Afro-diaspora—a notion Aunt Hester did not have direct linguistic access to in her lifetime—one attempt to name 
      and maintain and protect her beforeness, its gorgeous mundanity, its black excellence, its undeniable effervescent joy?</p>

     <p>
      To give further context to this thought process, I will engage a passage from the third chapter of 
      Frederick Jameson’s <em><strong>Postmodernism</strong></em>, which elaborates upon the abstract and circular relationship between 
      business brands and business logos:<br><br>
     </p>
     <p id="Jameson">
      “For we have not yet sufficiently described the nature of the process whereby, even allowing for the perpetual 
      displacements we have insisted on, one such element—or sign or logo—somehow ‘comments’ on the other or serves as its 
      ‘interpretant.’ The content of that process, however, was already implicit in the account of the logo itself, which was
       described as the signal or shorthand for a certain kind of narrative. The microscopic atomic or isotopic exchange under 
       study here can therefore be nothing less than the capture of one narrative signal by another: the rewriting of one form 
       of narrativization in terms of a different momentarily more powerful one, the ceaseless renarrativization of already 
       existent narrative elements by each other”
     </p>
     <p id="no-indent">
      <br>According to Jameson, logos index narratives while recapitulating them, and also while reinforcing and being reinforced 
      by them. The power of any logo is in its ability to charge whatever narrative comes before into a single visual cue, and 
      this in turn makes it difficult to forget the aforementioned narrative or at least its affective stimulations. This is, 
      despite the connotative force of its malevolent intentions, an arguably ideal practice of intellectual accessibility. If 
      we take notes on marketing, then, as not merely a capitalist practice but an epistemic one, as a practice of using a vast 
      array of resources to efficiently create and share knowledge, we can likely manipulate its techniques for our own goals of 
      accessibility. What postmodern capitalism demonstrates to us, for better and for worse, is that accessibility is necessarily 
      a multimedia project.
     </p>
 
     <p class="no-indent">
      <img class="question" src="img/jpeg/Neon-Logo.png">
      Here I am emphasizing the significance of different media working together to convey the same or similar material 
      simultaneously from and toward different angles. In other words, the elements of this synthesized yet distinguishable 
      “plurality” of media, in combination with their accompaniment of one another as well as the commons of their intentions, 
      generates a kinship surplus which in turn renders each “individual” element wholly effective. When the advertisement 
      jingle plays at the same time as and/or as the punctum of the visual stream, you don’t have to memorize the visual anymore 
      insofar as the song does the work of memorizing it for you and vice-versa. Add a metanarrative and a logo to the mix and 
      an entire semiotic environment—one that can retroactively pull or throw you back into it from any starting point—has been 
      coherently set.     </p>
     <p class="no-indent">
      Yet while postmodern capitalism or video art might be said to have mastered such an artform within digital media, it is
       by no means new as it has always been a fundamental aspect of establishing reality. By the time Jameson in 1989 shows 
       apprehension at “the ceaseless renarrativization of already existent narrative elements by each other,” Edward Said has 
       over a decade before conveyed similar anxieties toward the centuries-old ceaseless renarrativization of Western academic 
       citation and its contributions to an oppressive orientalism. Thus, this process of multimedia, (and here two of the same 
       kind of media working together counts as multimedia, e.g. two authors citing each other, or, more notably, the famous 
       Disney channel special crossover episode), differently repeating and redoubling, citing and inciting each other toward the 
       purpose of a broader experience, is one I would like to call <strong><em><u>coincitation</u></em></strong>. 
       Coincitation is worldmaking. What can we do with this?</p>

     <p><em>
       And here at the notion of coincitation, in its fact of difference without deferral or division whose nonplussing surplus 
         engineers and reengineers itself disjointedly, like water, in the immediately multimediate, mobile, and multidirectional 
         transfer among insight and incitement and excitement and excitation, is a convergence of the practice of citation and a 
         practice of what we might call <strong><em><u>liquidity</u></strong></em>. The picture tells a thousand words, and the essay paints its own picture: put 
         them together and they are still never the same even when they refer to the same thing, or to each other. Even when we put 
         the air right next to the water, even when we put the music right next to the screen, the radiation still moves differently, is refracted at different angles, inspiring different
          tangents. But it is precisely these tangents rooted in difference which learn to mix together in spookily diffractive 
          way(ve)s, generating a social force or animaterial surplus that ultimately blends and bleeds into an experience of psychoanalytic coherence. 
          At the same time, this notion of liquidity brings with it an asymptotic slice through the mathematico-philosophical dream of a locked-in transitive property, 
          crashing the party to announce a dynamic within which a and b can both equal c 
          but never equal each other even as they slide past and through each other. This is the ani/material or paraformational 
          break-down of universal constativity, therefore lending itself to an epistemic take down of hegemonic thought. The crowd learns to use 
          Derrida to differently and repeatedly laugh at Kant—which is to aspire joyfully despite the latter's imperative of 
          suffocation—learns to wield materiality in the sonning of the abstract, learns to revel in the fact that the law is always
           already broken even when it is ubiquitously pieced together. Even the part of us that believes in God and his omnipotence 
           must heed the specific materiality of his working through us—metaphysics cannot enact or even explain itself without physics.<br><br>
      </em></p>
     <em><p>
      And now, at the tipping of a hat in the borrowing of his lines, we might, albeit much more tenderly than Marx did Hegel, 
      flip Moten on his head (satirically baptizing him), supplementing one definition of blackness he offers as "theory of the 
      surreal presence" with an inversion of the thought into a notion of liquidity as slippery presence of the surreal theory. 
      And it is this presence, that moment of full nonfullness, when physiology and physics multi-mediate metaphysics which mediates
       them in turn, when the clock melts and the differences between become “the differences not between,” when great-aunty catches 
       the holy ghost and affect screams with the force of a reality, when Descartes gives way to his greatest fear as the fraction of
        dualism or a 3/5ths property swells into an improper "more-plus-less-than-one..." <em>that</em> is what I am looking 
        for in a Black black way. Because the 
        white way of all this is already always under way, when the overseer throws the whip at my back, when the mob harvests strange
         fruit, when the plantation wounds my kin and my kinship, when the prison and the school cage me in solitary confinement, when 
         the digital surrounds me with the hatred of my inventiveness, when the market goes to black, when the black market traffics 
         her, when the news pays no attention, when the museum puts me on display, when the police officer shoots me and doesn't know 
         why...<br><br></p>     </p>
     </em><p>
      But when I—when <em>we</em>—close our I's and look for it in a black way, in a dark way, in a strange way, when we engage in a Black 
      and Brown performance of study in the anoriginal crafting of a deep dark thought, I think we get to start to call it healing.<br><br>
