    <h2><strong>Ingredient 1: Simulacracy and the Surplus Human</strong><br><br></h2>
    <p> When Rembrandt is lauded by writers as a “connoisseur of the ordinary,”  
      we have to laugh at the ridiculousness of such a claim. Because, as TJ Clark reminds us , 
      the subjects of his paintings, for lack of a better term, are straight up bougie, obscenely ostentatious, 
      egregiously elite, undeniable benefactors of a bloodshed they would never have to see or experience, 
      though they might have chosen to spectate in the name of pleasure. But even so, maybe Rembrandt and the art 
      historians who celebrate him aren’t necessarily lying when they call these folks ordinary, when they imply 
      “this is what it means to be by de/fault.” This is to suggest that Rembrandt’s curators’ 
      titular acts are merely a symptom of a broader truth—that the “ordinary” has always been the 
      indicator of a conveniently euphemized existential surplus. Long story short, Rembrandt’s intense reds, 
      perturbing yellows, and anti-social anti-bluets (a “supreme colourist” indeed ) in turn allow art historians 
      to paint and then commodity-fetishize the standardization of an ontological abstraction.<br><br></p>

      <img class="pearl" src="img/Girl-with-a-Pearl-Earring.jpg">

      <p id="abstraction"><em>Abstraction: “the act of pulling away.”</em><br><br></p>
      <p>     If, to borrow the words of Freud, the human is the “heimlich,” which is to say the comfort of home, and the “unheimlich” is 
        a haunting by the home that has been forgotten , rhetorical and aesthetic abstraction does the work of that 
        forgetting in a fashion which Jean Baudrillard began to point out decades ago . This work of forgetting, this 
        representational swallowing of the normal by the normative, is the broader political and cultural function of 
        simulacra that Baudrillard fails to expand into on the way to his critique of postmodern capitalist society. 
        Just like how Derrida exposes J.L. Austin’s convenient and Philosophically necessary exclusion of the inconvenient 
        infelicitous utterance, which he later shows to be paradoxically constitutive of its more felicitous “opposite,”  
        I am trying to highlight the necessary convenience of Rembrandt’s curators, art historians, and writers sticking the 
        label of “ordinary” onto his subjects who are the furthest from, the necessary convenience of the all-white or marginally 
        diverse cast, the necessary convenience of calling white male comfort objectivity and institutional policy. And when
         Kant makes it imperative that any truth be universal, modernity has no choice but to make such convenience a total 
         global climate. Humanity weathers. Humanity oppresses. And the scene of subjection has always been a scene of 
         shaden-Freudian favorability. Modernity is little more than the simulacratic assault upon its own mother, the homely 
         heimlich merely the successful running away from the unheimlich, which as deep dark if not jet-black shadow is always 
         on its tail and in its bones . Haunting is a core part of who we are, even when it always hits us from behind.<br><br></p>

      <p>     How do we practice the possession of others in the contemporary? Here I am trying to pose, say, the convenience of a white-collar 
        worker getting a commodity like coffee at 6:00am on their way to work—coffee which enhances said worker’s productivity and profit 
        and is made by someone who had to inconveniently wake up at 5:00am, and whose only purpose in that moment is to make that person’s 
        coffee—as a kind of trace of, say, the enslaved as commodity whose only purpose is to harvest commodities like cotton that 
        eventually becomes that master’s profit. While slavery in the U.S., and with it the permanence of owning or being owned as 
        static and durable ontology, has been abolished in the legal setting, in the making of the coffee there is an ephemeral moment 
        in which the white-collar worker might feel power or a sense of ownership over the barista insofar as their wish was immediately 
        translated into, extended through, and/or possessive of the barista’s actions. I think it is moments like these: moments in which
         “the customer is always right” in ways that arguably descend from when whites could do no wrong to a Black body; moments we 
         call and value as service but are always also moments of convenience; passing moments where one and the Other convene in the 
         sole name of one’s enjoyment; I think it is moments like these that keep modernity afloat to the extent it keeps the 
         self-possessive human afloat among the realm of surplus. All that said I am, albeit only intuitively, inclined to say that 
         embedded within these moments are at least some residual dregs of whiteness as that property which allows one to own property, 
         as well as enslavement as that state of total commodification, total comfort, total possession, total extension, total surrogacy,
          and total surplus.<br><br></p>

      <p>     In light of this discussion, and additionally linking it to the ever-pressing prevalence of cultural appropriation, 
        we might make the jump and say that whiteness is nothing more than (the possession of ) blackness with insurance—anti-blackness
         is its policy and biopolitics is its broker. Its constitutional contract tells us that Althusserian subjection is simply the 
         cost to pay against the risk of flesh, which the broker must always demonstrate as possible to stay in business. And this 
         demonstration is why the subhuman must persist as an ontological category. So if you’re proud to call yourself human, I just 
         don’t trust you.<br>
