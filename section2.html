        <h2 id="title"><strong>(Grandma's Hands:)<br> On Digitality and its Predecessors</strong></h2>
        <p>     What are the relations between text, context, and contact, and how do they shift 
            together in light of the ever-accelerating introduction of new 
            technologies? Here I am deeply interested in the postmodern rise of digital technology as a new mode 
            of abstraction and a supposedly enhanced mode of modern comfort. However, I say <em>supposedly</em> enhanced here because the
             precedents of comfort and commodification set by the figure of the African slave is arguably greater than 
             that of today’s most advanced contemporary digital technological systems, if not partially constitutive of 
             said systems. What if the unilateral fungibility and usability of the slave set a consumptive standard that 
             modern and postmodern technological innovation has been trying to match ever since? It is not a stretch to say 
             that the enduring impressions of slavery include both the epigenetic transmission of trauma and the 
             shadenfreudean affective high resultant from enacting that trauma in the name of power, and, given its 
             centuries-long duration and absolute intensities, it is also not a stretch to claim that the figure of the 
             African slave functioned as the first and so far highest functioning automaton and source of surplus in modern 
             history. As Hartman tells us, during slavery each of the enslaved belonged simultaneously to one owner and to every 
             white citizen, which is to say the slave was both surplus and the socialization of surplus made anthropomorphic, and 
             even today the cultural outputs of the descendants of the enslaved are absolutely rushed by the trace of the compulsion 
             for this total and omnipresent ownership. Heeding Hartman’s inaugural text’s inaugural elaborations and Fred Moten’s 
             definitions , we might call this the musicality of whiteness, a musicality we tend to forget is always rooted in an 
             extremely brutal affair.<br><br></p>
    
        <p>     Taking into account the violence embedded in this brutality, given in the connotation of the 
              magnolia tree, the heat of the burning cross, the name “Aunt Hester,” and the very refusal by those who 
              lived through such atrocities to even speak its rememories, I want to propose a heretofore unrecognized but 
              crucial distinction between hapticality and haptics. Where hapticality is a mode of black sociality 
              that occurs largely in concert, en masse, and without intention as a consequence and in the midst of black 
              struggle , haptics in the technological context is the manipulation of vibration and force to generate the 
              illusion of relatability and connection, an illusion that is not coincidentally conflated with interfacial 
              control and interactive facility—the comforts of possession. Without getting into the terrible details of its 
              narrative, what the overseer does to Aunt Hester is arguably a founding mode of haptics insofar as the cut of 
              her phonic materiality  is inextricable from the cut of Aunt Hester's flesh. In the absolute worst way, Douglass’s 
              overseer plays flesh as a percusso-melodic instrument by making Aunt Hester scream and making her hush at (and as) 
              his self-discretion—his reinforcement of control and ownership entails a performance in which he is right next to 
              Aunt Hester, but is by no means together with her. Perhaps the very idea of ownership, which is to say the possession 
              of an object, the possessive and vestibular reclamation of that which has been objected to, is how modernity attempts 
              to reconcile the fundamental antagonism and “incompossibility” between modern power and black sociality, between 
              institutional/philosophical protocol and corporeal need, between the demand for self-containment or self-possession and 
              the ever-pressing desire to spill over, between individualism and the consent not to be single.<br><br></p>
        <p>
              This is all to say that I am interested in the parallels, even if few, between Silicon Valley and the auction block, between the ship’s hold 
              and the hand-held, the slave as automaton and the relentless drive to make AI functionally anthropomorphic. 
              As mathematics and programming transform racist fantasy into a different kind of metaphysics, the algorithm is the 
              Enlightenment made plastic , exploitative spirituality made economic enterprise—it flexes with the booms and busts of 
              human life, postmodern, volatile, downright unsustainable. The LED screen by default is a black mirror reflecting what 
              we’ve always already known. But even as we know it, it is increasingly important to learn to know it differently, and 
              there is thus a toll to develop new tools with which to wage struggle. We’ve been veritably ambushed by a world wide 
              web whose abstractions guise thought processes in unprecedented ways, but we still might inspect its elements if we are 
              willing to get a bit STEMmy about it.<br><br></p>
