        <div class="text-container">
        <p>Blackness has always been mobile-friendly. Indeed, it isn’t blackness if it doesn’t move. Even when it’s 
            quiet and even when it’s still, there is motion and emotion, the “fecundity of the caress,”  dark matters’ 
            suffusive radiation through Philosophy. Motion, migration, social movement, the Charleston, the moonwalk, etc. ad infinitum 
            gets right at the infinity of blackness, and where the overseer seeks to affix it to the notion of a “brute materiality” 
            it has already proven its fugitive animateriality. And what if the movement of the matter of blackness has nothing to 
            do with where it goes? What if the path toward liberation doesn’t have to be so straightforward? The dream of freedom 
            has never been in the head but in the chest, the stomach, the legs, “spoken with the whole body,” ready to move even 
            if randomly. It is on this random and/or improvised ground that we might float up and away from the bottom line insofar 
            as it reveals that freedom has never been a line. Black thought is thought that moves in such a way.<br><br></p>

        <p>I want to help my people, including my “self,” learn to move in the dark again—to, with unenlightened synesthetic 
            blur, locate the echo and follow it home, which has always been the following. Freedom, as if on the brink of an 
            outright mythology, calls us to make some of this shit up impromptu, on the fly as the ever-tangential centri-fugitive. 
            A shadow-dwelling Flying Lotus, you’ll never catch us  and we’ll never get away. This is the ineffable qualia of the 
            containerization of blackness, the “nonperformative or ante-performative social field”  where one learns what it is to 
            be not enough at the same time they are more than this world could ever handle. This so-called “zone of nonbeing” is 
            where Surya Bonaly goes when she is in the air. More plus less than the standards of the judges’ purview, she is
             (single-footedly) an airborne disruption—a knife gliding along the fabric it cuts. Here Bonaly is wavy, not particular, 
             as the very apex of her offerings is the very point at which she disappears within the gaze of institutional guidelines 
             (indeed, Performance Studies is where one goes to marvel at object impermanence). The admission of her dream gets deferred,
              lost in the ether of an untranslatable diagesis—blackness is a permanent tip of the tongue phenomenon, a “humming in 
              the face of the unsayability of words.” Bonaly’s protest is a magic act, a cruel theater in which she pulls the future 
              out of a wayward hat. She might also be said to be queering the scene here insofar as she bends to the shape of another's 
              dream structure, evaporates as she touches you, resounds even when she cannot register.<br><br></p>

        <p>An elegantly aestheticized rendition of George Jackson , what is the duration of Bonaly’s bladed flight? Duration is 
            the <s>surplus</s> nonpluss of time . How enduring is the celebration that gives velocity to the resistance of this object, 
            who is afterwards immediately objected to? Bonaly is by no means a villain, but she is an antagonist 
            and we should celebrate that. Borrowing from Tina Campt , we might say the kin-aesthetic of her photograph is a song. 
            It rings. It tweets. It vibrates at illegible 
            frequency. What invaluable shame, the beauty that comes out of not knowing if you're gonna make it. Uncertainty, 
            difficulty, high stakes, pressure, relentlessly impending violence. This is where Bonaly lives, and maybe also every  
            other black person. Bonaly, like the fugitive slave, enacts what we might call an introgenic de-interpellation, a 
            withdrawal (and withdrawing of her overseers) from the drug of convenient obedience, the making of a scene
            in the brave breaking of a rule. 
            In this break, in the air, in the music, in her nonsense, the completeness in her incompleteness, is the "gift of disposession,"
            and in reception of this gift someone took a photo 
            that might’ve made Nina Simone proud insofar as it makes us feel a little bit free . And now I can look her up on my 
            computer, and instantly share her with others so that they feel free too. Might our wings learn to be made of plastic?<br><br> </p>
