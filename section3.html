            <p>but we must consider how the hum of the hummingbird necessarily becomes the scream of a 
                murder of crow, a craw, a crock [crock (noun): one that is broken down; insincere or foolish 
                talk; a complaining (social justice) hypochondriac], a crack which screams "do not step on me, 
                or Ima have to hurt yo mama!" </p>

            <p>Whether we "hum in the face of the unsayability of words"  or holler at that which catches us by
                a tow is a question regarding the chosen frequency of our illegibility (infra-read or ultra-violent?) 
                insofar as our musically performative, restive, resistive utterances can only ever be infelicitous, can 
                only ever miss their mark.</p>

            <p>Our impassioned response to the given order of things is thus a cantilevered bridge reaching helplessly 
                (which is to say self-sufficiently) and haplessly into an open ocean of mut[e]ation; the phonic material 
                speech act being firmly rooted in a diasporically understood experience of subjection, and its receiver 
                (power) woefully lacking foundation, or more precisely being founded upon a judgemental cut or clipping 
                of a primordial and ante-normative antenna. This is what is at stake when we say that objects can and do 
                resist while also admitting the subaltern cannot speak.</p>

            <p>Maybe this is what it sounds like to be a problem, to be cursed with the drama of a letter unsent. Forlorn, 
                purloined, intercepted, returned to sender—ink drowned in tidal rage against any hope of knowability. Call 
                unanswered, signal too high, demand without command, hummingbird in futile search of a well-kempt flower 
                ("please leave The Message"). </p>

                but are shared all over nonetheless. A tear in the world streams violently from a sunken eye. The wise 
                old man points to the horizon of the event. His wrinkles grin with anticipation: 
                "follow me and you gon' cross a bridge to nowhere…"</p>
