                Questions regarding care and kinship tend to be framed to the scale of residential and community geographies, 
                but this doesn’t have to be the sole case anymore. If this is so, there is a demand here for increased 
                attention to and working for dramatic reorientations toward the uses of digital technology and by extension 
                popular culture. In addition, an even broader part of this demand requires us to shift our very conception of 
                struggle from a merely negative model of dialectic opposition to a supplementarily affirmative process of re/search,
                black study, and continual inventiveness. If your idea of revolution is the conventional theater of a violently blown 
                up or taken-over government, what I am proposing here will not be seen as at all radical. That said, revolution and 
                struggle must be framed less simply than as the waging of a war against oppression that we either absolutely win or absolutely lose. 
                Perhaps Christina Sharpe helps us do this by framing Black being as the working of white weather, as weather is not 
                something you defeat or are defeated by, but rather is something you make a living in account of. 
                This is not at all to denounce the absolute necessity for 
                direct antagonism, but to reframe said antagonism as one tool with which we carve oases, dig up wells, protect harvests, 
                clear the air for black being. Take back your time, take back your breath, share the air with me—watch the commons 
                infiltrate the lungs with fresh zest for rebellion. And then we might move together. Working in the wake of Christina 
                Sharpe's work, and working in the fact that humanity weathers, struggle must become seen as ecological.

                 <p>Through a brico-logic approach to the digital we can net-work ourselves into an improved 
                     protection of global blackness as that para-ontological ground which violates epistemic monocropping. 
                     The ground is risky, demonic even, a vast collection of animaterial ephemera and potential futures. Through blackness we are 
                     kinnected—at the end of the light of the day, we are armed with each other. And we are tired, and we are frail, 
                     and we are rubber back for more. The soothe ensemble, chicken noodle, broth is warm and everlasting. We just 
                     wanna name that name, even though we've just forgotten—repossess the table where we all used to eat, be happy.</p>
